permalink: /publication/Double-Layer-Combination-Algorithm
excerpt: 'This paper designs a low-carbon model and focuses on the real-time information-sharing network in order to get sustainable strategies promptly and exactly. The design problem is concerned with determining optimal integration strategies on a series of multilocation, multipath, and multiwarehouse freight provided by an information-sharing network to find an effective balance between the total costs and carbon emission.'
