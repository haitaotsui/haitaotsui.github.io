excerpt: 'In this paper, we consider the two-center problem on uncertain points on a real line. The input is a set $\calP$ of $n$ uncertain points on the line. Each uncertain point is represented by a probability density function that is a piecewise uniform distribution (i.e., a histogram) of complexity $m$. The goal is to find two points (centers) on the line so that the maximum expected distance of all uncertain points to their expected closest centers is minimized. A previous algorithm for the uncertain $k$-center problem can solve this problem in $O(mn\log mn + n\log^2n)$ time. In this paper, we propose a more efficient algorithm solving it in $O(mn\log m+n\log n)$ time. Besides, we give an algorithm of the same time complexity for the discrete case where each uncertain point follows a discrete distribution.'
