excerpt: 'A vehicle-commodity matching problem (VCMP) is presented for service providers to reduce the cost of the logistics system. The vehicle classification model is built as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is designed to solve the parameter estimation of GMM. A nonlinear mixed-integer programming model is constructed to minimize the total cost of VCMP. The matching process between vehicle and commodity is realized by GMM-EM, as a preprocessing of the solution.'
