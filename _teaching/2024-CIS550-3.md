 Course Description:
 This course offers a systematic study of algorithms and their complexity, including sorting, searching, selecting, and algorithms for graphs. Algorithm design techniques including greedy, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming and network flow are also covered. NP-complete problems will be briefly introduced as the topic of computational complexity. Algorithm implementation is required as a form of programming projects.
